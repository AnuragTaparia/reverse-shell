## Single Client

- In this single server-client connection can be made
- You can run server.py on your machine or on server/remote machine and client.py on target machine
- If you are running server.py on your local system than make sure that target machine and your system are in the same network
- The other thing you can do is host the server.py on a server, So that you don't have to worry about being in the same network as your target system
- **bye** command will terminate the connection from both the side
